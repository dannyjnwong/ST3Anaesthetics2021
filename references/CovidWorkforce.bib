  abstract = {The coronavirus pandemic has caused enormous disruption to routine healthcare in many countries, with large numbers of patients requiring hospital treatment for COVID-19.1 In the UK National Health Service (NHS) many routine care pathways were rapidly suspended to redeploy staff, hospital beds and equipment to handle the massive influx of patients. Surgical procedures were cancelled for all but the most urgent cases.2 In this issue of BMJ Quality and Safety , the Corona Hands Collaborative group report the results of a cohort study conducted over a 2-week period in April 2020, during the peak of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK.3 Data were collected for 1093 patients undergoing upper limb surgery in 74 NHS hospitals. A clinician survey captured data describing surgical cancellations, operating room capacity and infection control procedures at each hospital. The principal finding was that, in this patient population, the risk of death within 30 days after surgery was very low ({$<$}0.1\%). While 19 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, only one patient died, and the reported postoperative complications match the expected pattern for upper limb surgery. The authors conclude that low-risk surgery can be safely delivered in the context of the pandemic. In any observational study, an important source of bias is misclassification of the exposure or patient outcome. In this case, the identification of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and diagnosis of COVID-19 warrants discussion. SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, which requires a test (usually viral PCR) to identify it. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can be symptomatic or asymptomatic. COVID-19 is the clinical disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 and, in some situations, can be diagnosed without a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result.4 Due to the limited availability of SARS-CoV-2 testing early in the pandemic, the authors' definition of SARS-CoV-2 included patients \ldots},

The number of cancelled surgical procedures owing to Covid-19, and the reintroduction of surgical acivirt, was modelled.This was a modelling study using Hospital Episode Statistics data (2014\textendash 2019). Surgical procedures were grouped into four urgency classes. Expected numbers of surgical procedures performed between 1 March 2020 and 28 February 2021 were modelled. Procedure deficit was estimated using conservative assumptions and the gradual reintroduction of elective surgery from the 1 June 2020. Costs were calculated using NHS reference costs and are reported as millions or billions of euros. Estimates are reported with 95 per cent confidence intervals.A total of 4\,547\,534 (95 per cent c.i. 3\,318\,195 to 6\,250\,771) patients with a pooled mean age of 53.5 years were expected to undergo surgery between 1 March 2020 and 28 February 2021. By 31 May 2020, 749\,247 (513\,564 to 1\,077\,448) surgical procedures had been cancelled. Assuming that elective surgery is reintroduced gradually, 2 328\,193 (1\,483\,834 \textendash{} 3\,450\,043) patients will be awaiting surgery by 28 February 2021. The cost of delayed procedures is \texteuro 5.3 (3.1 to 8.0) billion. Safe delivery of surgery during the pandemic will require substantial extra resources costing \texteuro 526.8 (449.3 to 633.9) million.As a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic, provision of elective surgery will be delayed and associated with increased healthcare costs.},

  abstract = {Between October 2020 and January 2021, we conducted three national surveys to track anaesthetic, surgical and critical care activity during the second COVID-19 pandemic wave in the UK. We surveyed all NHS hospitals where surgery is undertaken. Response rates, by round, were 64\%, 56\% and 51\%. Despite important regional variations, the surveys showed increasing systemic pressure on anaesthetic and peri-operative services due to the need to support critical care pandemic demands. During Rounds 1 and 2, approximately one in eight anaesthetic staff were not available for anaesthetic work. Approximately one in five operating theatres were closed and activity fell in those that were open. Some mitigation was achieved by relocation of surgical activity to other locations. Approximately one-quarter of all surgical activity was lost, with paediatric and non-cancer surgery most impacted. During January 2021, the system was largely overwhelmed. Almost one-third of anaesthesia staff were unavailable, 42\% of operating theatres were closed, national surgical activity reduced to less than half, including reduced cancer and emergency surgery. Redeployed anaesthesia staff increased the critical care workforce by 125\%. Three-quarters of critical care units were so expanded that planned surgery could not be safely resumed. At all times, the greatest resource limitation was staff. Due to lower response rates from the most pressed regions and hospitals, these results may underestimate the true impact. These findings have important implications for understanding what has happened during the COVID-19 pandemic, planning recovery and building a system that will better respond to future waves or new epidemics.},

Considerable worry has also been caused by reports about anaesthetists dying at a younger age than other specialists as well as by reports about higher than average suicide rates among anaesthetists. Maybe as a consequence, many young doctors are reluctant to choose anaesthesiology as their future specialty. The aim of this study was to investigate what difficulties trainee anaesthetists experience at work. Methods: Nineteen trainee anaesthetists in six Swedish hospitals were interviewed. Phenomenological analysis of the interview text was performed. Results: All trainees had experienced considerable, sometimes extreme demands at work. Most of them often felt insufficient and inadequate and had problems with the professional role. Support from consultants was sometimes lacking. Some trainees expressed deep feelings of loneliness and helplessness in difficult clinical situations. Conclusions: This study shows that trainee anaesthetists have to live up to high work demands, often with very little support. Because too much stress is an obstacle to professional learning, such working conditions are a hindrance to good specialist education. The first measure to be taken should be to ensure that all trainee anaesthetists always have easy access to senior cover.},

This is concern for the safety and wellbeing of these doctors and for the patients they treat. To date, there has been no in-depth evaluation of these issues among UK anaesthetic trainees to examine which groups may be most affected, and to identify the professional and personal factors with which they are associated. We conducted an anonymous electronic survey to determine the prevalence of perceived stress, risk of burnout/depression and work satisfaction among anaesthetic trainees within South-West England and Wales, and explored in detail the influence of key baseline characteristics, lifestyle and anaesthetic training variables. We identified a denominator of 619 eligible participants and received 397 responses, a response rate of 64\%. We observed a high prevalence of perceived stress; 37\% (95\%CI 32\textendash 42\%), burnout risk 25\% (21\textendash 29\%) and depression risk 18\% (15\textendash 23\%), and found that these issues frequently co-exist. Having no children, {$>$} 3 days sickness absence in the previous year, {$\leq$} 1 h.week-1 of exercise and {$>$} 7.5 h.week-1 of additional non-clinical work were independant predictors of negative psychological outcomes. Although female respondents reported higher stress, burnout risk was more likely in male respondents. This information could help in the identification of at-risk groups as well as informing ways to support these groups and to influence resource and intervention design. Targeted interventions, such as modification of exercise behaviour and methods of reducing stressors relating to non-clinical workloads, warrant further research.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Fatigue and distress have been separately shown to be associated with medical errors. The contribution of each factor when assessed simultaneously is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of fatigue and distress with self-perceived major medical errors among resident physicians using validated metrics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective longitudinal cohort study of categorical and preliminary internal medicine residents at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. Data were provided by 380 of 430 eligible residents (88.3\%). Participants began training from 2003 to 2008 and completed surveys quarterly through February 2009. Surveys included self-assessment of medical errors, linear analog self-assessment of overall quality of life (QOL) and fatigue, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the PRIME-MD depression screening instrument, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of self-perceived, self-defined major medical errors was recorded. Associations of fatigue, QOL, burnout, and symptoms of depression with a subsequently reported major medical error were determined using generalized estimating equations for repeated measures. RESULTS: The mean response rate to individual surveys was 67.5\%. Of the 356 participants providing error data (93.7\%), 139 (39\%) reported making at least 1 major medical error during the study period. In univariate analyses, there was an association of subsequent self-reported error with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (odds ratio [OR], 1.10 per unit increase; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.16; P = .002) and fatigue score (OR, 1.14 per unit increase; 95\% CI, 1.08-1.21; P {$<$} .001). Subsequent error was also associated with burnout (ORs per 1-unit change: depersonalization OR, 1.09; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.12; P {$<$} .001; emotional exhaustion OR, 1.06; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.08; P {$<$} .001; lower personal accomplishment OR, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.92-0.97; P {$<$} .001), a positive depression screen (OR, 2.56; 95\% CI, 1.76-3.72; P {$<$} .001), and overall QOL (OR, 0.84 per unit increase; 95\% CI, 0.79-0.91; P {$<$} .001). Fatigue and distress variables remained statistically significant when modeled together with little change in the point estimates of effect. Sleepiness and distress, when modeled together, showed little change in point estimates of effect, but sleepiness no longer had a statistically significant association with errors when adjusted for burnout or depression. CONCLUSION: Among internal medicine residents, higher levels of fatigue and distress are independently associated with self-perceived medical errors.},

Since Christmas, hospitals in London and the south east have come under significant pressure from high covid-19 infection rates, with one hospital trust forced to cancel some cancer operations and another now operating in ``disaster medicine mode.'' During the first wave of the pandemic the Nightingale Hospital London, based at the ExCeL centre, was set up to take patients with covid-19 requiring critical care. However, only 51 patients were treated at the facility before it was closed in May.1 A spokesperson for the NHS in London told The BMJ , ``We are working hard to prepare NHS Nightingale Hospital London to take patients if necessary. It will provide rehabilitation for people who are recovering after an emergency hospital stay and who are not covid positive, freeing up other beds in hospital for covid patients.''

  abstract = {Background Decisions to admit high-risk postoperative patients to critical care may be affected by resource availability. We aimed to quantify adult ICU/high-dependency unit (ICU/HDU) capacity in hospitals from the UK, Australia, and New Zealand (NZ), and to identify and describe additional `high-acuity' beds capable of managing high-risk patients outside the ICU/HDU environment. Methods We used a modified Delphi consensus method to design a survey that was disseminated via investigator networks in the UK, Australia, and NZ. Hospital- and ward-level data were collected, including bed numbers, tertiary services offered, presence of an emergency department, ward staffing levels, and the availability of critical care facilities. Results We received responses from 257 UK (response rate: 97.7\%), 35 Australian (response rate: 32.7\%), and 17 NZ (response rate: 94.4\%) hospitals (total 309). Of these hospitals, 91.6\% reported on-site ICU or HDU facilities. UK hospitals reported fewer critical care beds per 100 hospital beds (median=2.7) compared with Australia (median=3.7) and NZ (median=3.5). Additionally, 31.1\% of hospitals reported having high-acuity beds to which high-risk patients were admitted for postoperative management, in addition to standard ICU/HDU facilities. The estimated numbers of critical care beds per 100 000 population were 9.3, 14.1, and 9.1 in the UK, Australia, and NZ, respectively. The estimated per capita high-acuity bed capacities per 100 000 population were 1.2, 3.8, and 6.4 in the UK, Australia, and NZ, respectively. Conclusions Postoperative critical care resources differ in the UK, Australia, and NZ. High-acuity beds may have developed to augment the capacity to deliver postoperative critical care.},
