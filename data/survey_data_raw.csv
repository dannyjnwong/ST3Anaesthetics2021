We made it through and I feel so fortunate that we didn't lose any loved ones etc but we are both so burnt out. I was on a surge rota for a year until March 2021. I was very conscious that my portfolio could have been a lot better for the ST3 interviews but I could not have physically done it. I am so exhausted. I don't know where I would have had the time to do extra projects, run teaching sessions etc. During the interview when they asked me about the most difficult period of my training I just wanted to say 'you honestly have no idea'. I am not a dramatic type at all and tend to just get on with stuff but honestly after the amount of sacrifice not to be given a training job this year feels beyond insulting. I will do my non-training post and then see where I get to but I think my husband and I will probably take our now 2yo to Rep of Ireland and find work there. The Irish health system has its faults of course but I don't think I could find it in me to go back into a training scheme run by the faceless HEE.

There did not seem to be any consideration put forward to trainees in a similar position. The fact that higher specialty training numbers have been going down on average over recent years is baffling when simultaneously reading news articles about the shortage of consultant anaesthetists and how vital anaesthetists have been during the pandemic. It almost seems as though some of the mistakes from the MMC era are being repeated again.

On balance, being in a training programme is a better guarantee towards my completion of training, and offers better pay/ study leave/ budgets than holding trust grade jobs. I also work on a tier 2 visa, which meant that going into training was a more secure route to having it renewed (the visa expires immediately after the end of my CT2 year and if I had not secured a CT3 job well before this with sufficient time to renew the visa I would be forced to leave the country). 

However, I am still deeply unsatisfied with the process because it now means that I work in a completely different deanery to my husband who is also medical, will not be eligible for IDT, and will be away from the home that we have just bought. I do not feel that our personal circumstances are considered with much weight by HEE, and some additional flexibility to the IDT process would promote wellbeing and make training more sustainable. 

Separately, I also think that the recruitment process is not fit for purpose and fails to discriminate between so many excellent candidates. The interview process is also not objective, open to great variability between interviewers and susceptible to a wide range of bias.",35

I appreciate that there has to be a method that allows for the limited (which is another problem) number of posts to be given out, but the current method is discriminatory. If ANRO insist on this method then each point needs to be reviewed for its impact. From what I have read SJT type application would be more fair.

My particular concerns were the lack of engagment with applicants from the ANRO - delay in answering questions and use of an incredibly unfair scoring system for the August 2020 entry. This was followed by a policy of repeating the same uncommunicative response when the unfair scoring was pointed out and refusal of acceptance of any subsequent evidence. This had a profound impact on the situation of my wife and I especially since at the following round the fact that I was able to upload sufficient evidence lead to me gaining a position only 6 months later.

For the Feb 2021 entry uploading of evidence was fraught with problems with the platform crashing when attempting to upload things. The interview was also very short and I don't know how the interviewers were able to reasonably assess my competencies in such a short time period.

This is particularly true considering that these trainees are likely to continue working in this capacity for a couple of years until Stage 2 posts become available. There will obviously be an incredible bottleneck at that stage for jobs many will look to pursue the CESR route, if we are lucky enough to retain them in our specialty.

Upon starting our CT1 year we were told we would have a 3 year training programme due to the curriculum change, this was changed at last minute in the middle of the pandemic. We were then told we would have to pass our exams within 2 years of ct not three and after passing the mcq not allowed to sit our viva in the most convenient setting due to backlog. We then had Reg applications moved forward significantly with no notice. I think that the relatively low numbers of ct2s going directly into training from st3 demonstrates how disregarded by the college we have been. 
I also feel the recruitment process for st3 was unnecessarily vague and there was no reason to so heavily weight portfolio when a clinical station would have been easily feasible as demonstrated in the online viva. Those who have been working covid rotas will inevitably have fewer audits/research but will probably be clinically more experienced. 
The message coming from the college is that “all will be fine” but there has been very little in the way of organised LAT/CT3 competency jobs. At the end of the day we have mortgages to pay and we can't rely on promises which, going by their track record, are likely to be empty.

The GMC and RCoA should have delayed implementation of the new curriculum and ST4 entry, especially given the other problems with Covid affecting recruitment, and now that all international graduates have parity with homegrown candidates. The IMG issue is actually a nightmare. You have international graduates, most of whom are grossly overqualified for ST3 or even ST4 entry, who outclass the UK trainees (on paper) because of their excessive experience overseas. They should be mandated to choose the CESR pathway because allowing them into a CCT programme is leaving UK doctors without jobs.

Also, recruitment to anaesthesia should become run-through. That way, at least if you don't get in, you haven't already spent 2-3+ years doing anaesthesia - the skills cannot be used in any other specialty so you end up having to start again from scratch. All this, at the same time that people are trying to settle down and start families.

The whole situation is a disgrace. The GMC, HEE and RCOA should all be ashamed of themselves. They have let down a generation of doctors who have given their lives to the job, even before Covid happened. They are treating Anaesthetists like disposable numbers. It is like firing a soldier and throwing him out into the street as soon as he has come home from war, having served his country and developed any number of mental disorders. It is despicable. As soon as I become a substantive consultant and don't need to give any more of my hard-earned money to the RCOA, I'm planning on cancelling my membership permanently. If I could, I would do the same with the GMC. Why should we have to pay for the privilege of having our lives played with by these utter cowards?!

Due to the pandemic those who would usually have gone abroad can not, those who were abroad have returned, and due to the curriculum change many have seen this as a ""last chance"" to get an ST3 number all together leading to the large number of applications and subsequent stress and disappointment. For those not getting a number this year, it is a mandatory two years out of training forcing them to undergo further application and interview cycles, both nationally and locally - potentially four over a two and a half year cycle, including the application round just gone.

The provision of CT3 ""top up"" posts has not been centrally co-ordinated or offered equitably, being down to hospital trusts to organise and fund meaning there is a 'postcode lottery' of sorts to obtain these. I am recently engaged, and my partner has had an ST post for the last year that she cannot move from. We would not qualify to apply for an inter-deanery transfer unless she was to give birth due to the restrictions on these. There is no provision of top up posts in a commutable distance from where she works, even hours away. In my mid-thirties and starting a family, it is not practical to move across the country for a top up post. Locally trusts are not recruiting many fellow posts, presumably because their existing core trainees are now staying on and filling those rota slots.

I finished Core Training during 2020 and the first wave of the pandemic, despite redeployment to ICU and missing some training. I stayed in a local fellow post largely due to uncertainty during the pandemic and a wish to help out. I am now at a loss as to what to do with my career and have limited options, and am subsequently considering leaving the profession altogether. I feel abandoned by the NHS, HEE and the RCoA.",154

One of the extra years experience is due to having to take extra time to pass the exams, which is an issue that the RCoA are aware of quoting it as the main reason for the attrition rate 0f 48% from CT2 to ST3.  Additionally there has been a paucity of posts for the last 2 rounds not just the latest (although it is the latest which has made the newspapers.) As such there are an increasing amount of non-training grade doctors who have the requirements to start an ST3 place but also a decreasing amount of posts.  Essentially there has been created an enormous bottle neck from the last 2 years of hundreds of non-training grade doctors who can't get a post, which will continue to grow.  The RCoA sounds increasingly like a government organisation rolling out the same vitriol again and again but with no action, my colleagues have lost faith, they do not represent us. We are doctors who have dedicated our professionals lives to be anaesthetists and have made huge sacrifices in terms of family, housing etc and have been abandoned with no plan in place to support us.  Instead the RCoA is championing Anaesthetic PA's rather than the anaesthetists.  I have no confidence in the RCoA, a feeling which is echoed by many of my colleagues up and down the country.  Many of my colleagues have given up on their dream of becoming anaesthetists despite passing all the exams and have changed medical careers, I fear the problem will continue and we will loose hundreds of good anaesthetists in favour of the Anaesthetic PA's.

Having not succeeded in August 2020 application, I had to secure a non training grade post last year after completing CT2. This was a difficult process with very little guidance at the time. I was again unsuccessful for February 2021. The stress of working on covid rotas, as well as having no study budget etc on my current role while trying to boost my cv to make me more ""employable"" has pushed me to the brink of burnout. I was one of the lucky few to get a job this time round, but I wonder how much toll the process has taken on my mental health with the amount of stress I and my colleagues were under. I feel so sad and angry on behalf of my colleagues who were unsuccessful in this application round. Some of the applicants are extremely talented anaesthetic CT2s who undoubtedly would have got jobs a few years ago.

Furthermore, I very much doubt many of the CV boosting activities I did have made me a better anaesthetist - in fact I am due to start ST3 in August having not even given an anaesthetic for the last 12 months because the application process gave more weight to me working in Emergency Medicine as an SHO rather than getting more experience in anaesthetics.

A last note re fairness of the application process. Many CT2s have lost out on training posts to experienced anaesthetists trained abroad who have applied for ST3 jobs as a 5 year fast track to gaining a CCT in anaesthetics. These anaesthetists are very talented and often consultants back home with many years of experience in anaesthesia. They are often working in jobs (e.g. senior clin fellow/staff grade type positions) that UK trainees post core-training are not even able to apply for due to lack of experience. Allowing them to subsequently apply for a 5 year TRAINING programme seems very flawed and an insult to them and the UK core trainees who are unable to get these jobs. A training job should serve the purpose its name suggests - to TRAIN anaesthetists. I fully agree that experienced anaesthetists from abroad have lots of experience to offer our NHS and they should have the opportunity to become UK consultants, but if they have already completed training elsewhere, surely this should be via the CESR pathway that is not appropriate for post-CT2 trainees. It seems absurd that they are having to opt for ST3 training because of how difficult CESR training can be. The RCOA website says that the MTI scheme is not a route into ST3 training, but I have seen anaesthetists completing the MTI scheme do just that successfully gain ST3 jobs in this round. So to protect our national training scheme whilst also increasing the number of trained anaesthetists to bolster the workforce, should we not be aiming to simplify the CESR process for these very talented and brilliant anaesthetists who are providing their expertise to help our (failing) NHS?",172

During the first wave, there was no audit activity or regional teaching opportunities at all in my place of work. By the time I started my CT3, there wasn't a huge amount of time to complete things ready for application. 

I know why it was decided that you could apply for ST3 with only the MCQ, but I didn't feel like the same allowances were made in other areas. So, by working hard to pass the full primary, I feel I was actually disadvantaged having done so. I should have spent that time working on audits etc.. instead it seems. 

The changes to the curriculum were also discussed, then delayed because of the pandemic and then introduced anyway. It's been incredibly stressful trying to work out where this leaves us all.

I feel the interview process was quite subjective with a large emphasis on global score, and only one panel with only one style of assessment rather than similar to previous format with multiple assessments (presentation, clinical etc). Every point makes a big difference in terms of ranking yet you can only dispute your self assessment score if the discrepancy was more than 5 points which doesn't make sense. The goalposts keep changing and I don't understand why people were allowed to apply without having completed the FRCA primary considering only one exam sitting was cancelled in the last year and there has still been ample opportunity to pass. Due to the self assessment criteria points decreasing after 24 months in complementary specialties (which I already have), I am now in the position of having to decide between doing something that I would enjoy and would be good for my learning and experience and make me a better anaesthetist (eg PICU/retrieval/prehospital) but decrease my self assessment criteria points and doing another job that I don't want to do such as ICU fellow posts with exhausting on calls which won't develop me as a clinician/anaesthetist but won't drop my points.
More clarity is required about the new curriculum, and about what the method of assessment will be for entry into ST4 for 2023.
There should be some extra ST3/st4 posts for august 2022 given the large number of trainees affected who are caught up in the middle. The discrepancy between CT1 post numbers and ST3 post numbers is absurd, further amplifying the bottleneck. This issue is only going to get worse year on year, especially if the new curriculum improves the attrition rate between core and registrar training as anticipated due to more trainees passing the exam in time to progress.

Applications for ST3 recruitment closed in December 2020 so it must have been known for almost 5 months exactly how many trainees would be affected by these changes and the systems have not been put in place to support the significant numbers now stuck in between curriculums. This is only now gaining traction because the numbers involved have been released publicly and anger from those involved is growing. 

It is not clear if there will be enough CT3 equivalent jobs to go around and it is not looking as though the competition ratios will be any better when it comes to applying for ST4. It may well be more than another 2 years to wait to get a training number. It has also been said that CT3 equivalent posts cannot be guaranteed in the area in which you currently work. Particularly after the pandemic, I am not willing to uproot my life to another part of the country to take up a CT3 equivalent clinical fellow post which has absolutely no guarantee of leading to a training number at the end of it.

On a more general recruitment note, this is now the 3rd round of national recruitment I have been involved in since I graduated. Every few years we are expected to be open to moving house, county, or even country to take up coveted training numbers. I don't know of any other professional career that recruits in this way, which essentially amounts to a geographical lottery, and frequently separates families and support networks. 

Until this point of my career I had never considered moving abroad or leaving medicine. I love my job, but the lack of control we have over our own careers and personal lives when working within medicine in this country has lead me to seriously consider other options now.",257

This does not make us bad doctors or unworthy of progressing.

A large part of the blow is that there is no planned recruitment round for August 2022 and I can't really understand why. The vast majority of those who did not get a job this year probably get their CT3-equivalent competencies and would therefore be in a position to a start ST4, and with the numbers who were not successful, an August 2022 recruitment round would still be reasonably competitive. Delaying to 2023 when there will be a fresh batch completing their core training to add to the numbers will only exacerbate the problem. Holding an August 2022 ST4 recruitment round would be an excellent chance to get more people back into training and moving their careers forward. Those starting ST3 this August will be transitioning over to the new curriculum from August 2022 anyway, so I really don't see the need to not recruit next year, especially when the college seems to recognise the workforce shortages at all levels and increasing future demands in anaesthesia. I recognise that the college is not responsible for setting training numbers, but I can well imagine that they were involved with the decision not to have an August 2022 recruitment round, and simply don't understand that decision. A change of heart in favour of holding an August 2022 recruitment round would surely recognise the hard work and unprecedented sacrifice that this group of doctors in particular have made during the pandemic of the last 12-18 months and would certainly be a major boost for their morale, well-being and mental health.",261

As not spending time passing your exam during CT1-2 which is the conventional and expected route up until COVID is actually advantageous compared to spending months revising for an exam that does not contribute any weighting to the overall ST3 process! 

In addition to this, the rules for current ST3s from Feb 2021 intake for passing the primary FRCA by end of ST3 seem to have been relaxed, another goalpost move and arguably unfair advantage. 

The interview process seemed targeted at trainees with additional experience in anaesthesia (disadvantaging those who have gone straight through core training without any need for gaps etc.), especially when the first interview question is ""what is your clinical experience outside of core anaesthetics!""

There is significant weighting given to the interviewers being a single station with fairly generic questions that do not allow any demonstration of clinical acumen.

My other main grievance is with the College pressing on with a curriculum change that made the ST3 application process so competitive this year, with seemingly no proper plan in place for the 700 trainees left behind. Either more training places needed to be created, given the anaesthetic workforce vacancies, or there needed to be proper plans made for the 'top up jobs'- at the moment a list of curriculum requirements, not even connected to the LLP, is all that exists, for these posts that departments are supposed to organise despite not being funded to do so.

This information was from a college tutor from one training deanery (where I applied for my fellowship) and from my regional training programme director (an adjacent deanery).
I was then informed I could apply for a CT3 equivalency year, ie attend my planned fellowship, return to a CT3 training post and then apply for ST4.
I was then informed you cannot apply for stand alone CT3 position and I would effectively have to collect my own evidence of completion of competencies while sourcing my own employment until August 2023 when I can apply for ST4.
If I am then unsuccessful I would be heading into my third year of 'fellow' work or staff grade work and have been working in anaesthetics without a number longer than in a training post. I have no guarantees these roles will allow study leave, study budgets or allowing study leave for exam prep or courses (for example for the final FRCA).
Despite assurances to the contrary I am sure my application would be looked on less favourably than a trainee having completed their three years routinely, and this would only escalate with any subsequent failed applications (I am tied to the area via family commitments and work in a competitive deanery).
I now have one window to apply next February (2022) but would mean my planned fellowship is cut short (I had planned this as I went straight into training from F2) and I would have one shot at this application (where if I had been informed you cannot apply for CT3 equivalent positions an that there will be no ST4 application in August 2022, I would have also applied in this most recent batch).

Most people in the interview perform 'avergagely', so the portfolio then massively has a swing on who gets jobs or not. After the interviews, I realised that some people were interviewed by Consultants that knew them, which brings out a massive element of bias into the process. Finally, in Scotland, there were five new jobs recycled from ICU numbers at last minute, but for some reason they weren't recycled till after the upgrade deadline. This meant that people with significantly lower rankings got their first choice job (if they only put one region) in highly competitive regions. This completely undermines the whole interview process and it is extremely disheartening to hear of this, especially when these jobs were requested to be recycled on the 5th May (and weren't till 17th May).

It was clear from the self assessment feedback I received that they had incorrectly marked down my score in one of the domains, and had used this as a reason to reduce my global score. I initially submitted an appeal to ANRO, but was told that I did not meet the appeals criteria (as per applicant guidance section 6.3 here https://anro.wm.hee.nhs.uk/downloads). In order to qualify for an appeal, your self assessment score (submitted at the time of application) must have reduced by 5 marks or more by the consultant assessor. My score had actually increased between time of application and deadline for document upload as I had done some relevant things in the interim which scored on the self assessment criteria. As such, ANRO used this as a reason not to grant me an appeal.

Judging from social media this seemed to be a common issue, and the chair of the RCOA Anaesthetists in Training(AiT) Committee tweeted that those who did not reach the criteria for an appeal should lodge a formal complaint with ANRO. This was also echoed in an email sent out by the RCOA. I did just this, but received a similar reply; that I didn't qualify for an appeal and had no grounds for a complaint (the complaints procedure is here - https://specialtytraining.hee.nhs.uk/portals/1/Content/Resource%20Bank/Recruitment%20Documents/MDRS%20Complaints%20Policy%202021.docx). 

I found this extremely frustrating and disheartening; it wasn't as if someone had re-looked at my evidence and decided they disagreed, they had just refused to look at it. The initial appeals criteria cut-off seemed particularly arbitrary; especially in the context of a highly competitive application process where a single point could make the difference between getting a job and not. I emailed the RCOA AiT (and the Association of Anaesthetists Trainee committee) and received assurances that the RCOA training committee were liaising with ANRO and the MDRS to highlight trainee grievances with the system.

Shortly afterwards ANRO announced they were reopening another appeal window, with limited criteria (basically for clerical or admin errors);  for which I didn't qualify. I then didn't hear anymore about it. I discovered on social media (an hour before the deadline) that ANRO had emailed candidates who had been marked down between 1 and 4 marks details of the new appeals process; an email that I had not received. I am extremely fortunate that I happened to see this on social media, as I was able to submit a last minute appeal. On review my appeal was upheld and I was given 5 (!) extra points. I have no doubt that these extra points helped me secure the job I wanted.

I feel very strongly that at present the online self assessment system is not consistently marked and does not have a robust, transparent or fair appeals process.

The potential impact of the curriculum change and the change to recruitment at ST4 on trainees who have already completed core training has been apparent for years and overall there has been little in the way of concrete assurance that there would be a straightforward way to demonstrate equivalence and become eligible for ST4 recruitment if unsuccessful in this round - although some CT3 style posts are now being advertised this was after recruitment was all but completed so at the time before receiving an offer I felt no guarantee that I would be able to access such posts; there should be a formal mechanism to ensure all trainees who have completed core training and wish to continue with anaesthetics training are offered a CT3 post, and not a reliance on individual trusts filling gaps in the system.",449

First and foremost why is training not run-through? ST3 applications generate a lot of stress and soak up a lot of time (for both trainees and consultants), but to what benefit? Second, the metrics measured in the applications mostly have little to do with clinical competence as an anaesthetist - there is no attempt to measure if you're a good colleague, have great technical skills not shrewd clinical acumen; ICM applications at least attempt this by including a section on consultant feedback. Yet you do get points for having a prize in medical school irrespective of its relevance to anaesthesia... Next, why are there consistently fewer ST numbers than CT numbers? The anaesthetic training attrition rate is relatively low and is not entirely concentrated at the Core/Specialty checkpoint. Furthermore the appointed ST posts do not account for Whole Time Equivalents, with the increase in LTFT, parental leave and academic leave/OOPEs ST rotas are consistently under-filled affecting training opportunities due to the relative increase in service provision. Finally in Scotland when additional posts were funded due to existing anaesthetic ST trainees gaining ICM numbers (and thus having their funding taken over by ICM) these were distributed not to the trainees who otherwise would have been eligible for upgrades earlier in the process, but to lower ranked trainees who had yet to be offered a job due to inflexibility about where they were prepared to work. While this may be the letter of the existing rules, it seems to 'punish' flexibility setting little value on the financial, social and emotional costs that that flexibility incurs. Ultimately it undermines the sense that the application process is a true meritocracy (at least within the limits of the metrics assessed).",451

Although these variables could not all be controlled, it seems they would all lead to a fairly predictable rise in competition ratios. Although I have seen several statements from the RCOA since application results were released, I do not recall seeing any communications acknowledging this likely issue in the year leading up to this. Given that the increase in competition was fairly predictable, it was disappointing not see any acknowledgement of this prior to applications, with details of how the college would advocate for trainees at this point, or highlighting discussions with HEE raising these concerns etc. Everything feels like it's been extremely reactive rather than pro-active.

2. I note that in a recent article published in the Independent, Professor Wendy Reid, medical director of HEE stated 'We recognise this year is unique, which is why we are supporting trainees as much as possible … including additional recruitment rounds and more flexibility for applicants'. Whilst I am aware this is a statement from HEE rather than the RCOA etc, this seems more than a little ambiguous i.e. when will these 'additional recruitment rounds' be, and what format will the increased 'flexibility' take? When statements such as this pertain directly to anaesthetic trainees, it would be reassuring to see a direct response from the college/AoA, acknowledging that HEE will be asked to further clarify statements such as these. 

3. Finally with regard to the actual application process, I feel that some criteria are slightly unfair when judging trainees. For instance, the section on 'Undergraduate prizes and awards' seems particularly unfair given the wide variation in prizes awarded by universities to undergraduates. In addition, this does not seem in any way to recognise the current ability and commitment of anaesthetic trainees, who may have won several awards as post-graduates, but will receive no recognition for this. As a core trainee, I have also found myself at a disadvantage in 'Postgraduate experience in other specialties' when compared to my ACCS colleagues. It is hard not to feel that by committing to anaesthetics and working incredibly hard to secure a core training post following my foundation years, I am now penalised for this in my ST3 application having not completed a mandated year in medicine/EM.",470

1) Firstly anaesthetic trainees have been integral to manning the pandemic response and current core trainees have had their training and well being sacrificed to do this. Most trainees have done this willingly as they know they have skills that are absolutely necessary but this has taken a mental toll. Due to this, I feel many trainees have not had the time or mental bandwidth to be fully abreast of the changes that were coming and so although the curriculum change has been in the pipeline for a while, it has either come as shock to some or others just have not had time to prepare mentally for its implications
2) Secondly, even before covid it is well known there are huge shortages of anaesthetists as consultants and so it seems crazy that more numbers are not being created. The RCOA have been talking to NHSE for years and we know there will be a huge shortage of consultant anaesthetists within a few years. This seems even harder for current anaesthetists applying for registrar training to understand as why are they unable to secure training jobs now when the consultant posts are needed and will be even more necessary with post covid back log of surgery
3) Thirdly, although there are always some trainees who leave anaesthetics at this point as they do not competitively interview or succeed with application, this year is unique in the fact that truly excellent trainees do not have jobs. Trainees who are clinically above expectations, have excellent CVs (Prize winners, projects, audits, research etc) which they have done despite the onslaught of covid, and have brilliant situational awareness and human factor skills. It seems like a travesty that these trainees do not have jobs and although some will try to get back into training, many may well leave the UK or change speciality and this really is a loss to the NHS and the patients, and not least a waste of everyones' time and money so far (The trainees spending money on courses and exams and the tax payer having paid NHSE to start their training)

This was in part due to the fact that was only able to rank the Severn deanery due to family reasons, and then because I accepted an ICM number here. 

Due to very high competition levels, several attempts before gaining a number are common in Severn, usually people try for 2, 3 or 4 times before becoming successful or moving region, country or leaving the specialty. 

I believe this is caused in part by HEEs decision to recruit more SHOs than Registrars, which appears to serve the purpose of providing a driving pressure to move trainees to less popular areas at ST3. This is at the expense of trainees in popular areas. Many of my friends have not returned to the UK or entered GP training to avoid the Severn ST3 anaesthesia bottleneck. This is a great loss to the specialty as these are high performing trainees who performed well at interview, but did not clear the high bar required for this region.

I would favour reducing the number of CT1 posts in the popular regions and increasing the number of ST3 posts there . People are more likely to move at CT1, and so increasing CT1 numbers in less popular areas should result in higher fill rates later at ST3.

I also feel that the interview is very poor at differentiating between good candidates. To receives an offer in Severn one usually needs to score within the top ten to fifteen percent of interviewed candidates. A few marks make a huge difference, and much of the CV score relates to things that have no bearing on your ability to make the a good consultant anaesthetist. Prizes depend on the medical school more than the individual, intercalations are ridiculously over rewarded and working as a medical registrar is objectively better preparation for anaesthesia than working as an SHO. Not only are the marks in these areas poorly thought out, but they are historical and cannot be changed or improved on. 

The most impressive lines in my CV did not score me any points, and there was no opportunity to discuss them as they did not fit into the rigid framework of the interview either. I have eventually been successful by working hard on the aspects of my CV that I could change, but it took one interviewer to give me the full forty marks before I was eventually offered a job. 

By contrast in the ICM interview I interviewed twice for Severn, receiving offers both times. 

Overall, I believe the interview process has been designed with national goals in mind and discriminates poorly between candidates. It has been very stressful stage of my career, and I am extremely grateful to the regional CDs, college tutors and subspecialty leads who allowed me to carry on training outside of the training programme during this process.",490

I have been unable to revise adequately to pass my exams because of surge rotas. I have missed out on many educational opportunities. I felt that, my recognising all of this, I was doing the right thing. But now I feel like I'm being penalised for not being able to keep up with everyone and find the time (how?

A lot of the information was published only in the last few months with little information on what constitutes an appropriate 'CT3 top up' post/how these posts will be provided. The provision of CT3 posts varies greatly across regions and trainees are not guaranteed to be able to access them. The nature of top up posts also vary greatly between deanery supported training posts to trust grade posts with more service provision expectation. The limited ST3 places in February and lack of ST4 recruitment in 2022 leaves trainees who have not been recruited in ST3 this August at a disadvantage and makes life planning (where to settle/buying a house/family planning etc) difficult when individuals don't know where they will be spending the rest of their training/whether they will get a training in a region of their choice.

2) The ST3 evidence verification process was very poorly conducted, with assessors clearly not aware of/not following explicit guidelines on the ANRO website on what evidence was acceptable. I was marked down by 8 points - most of which were reinstated on appeal. Why should we have to go through such a stressful process, meticulously following the guidelines, only to have to appeal in order for them to be (partially) correctly followed?

As someone who completed core anaesthetic training in February 2021 I am currently an “anaesthetic clinical fellow” that mostly provides service provision on ICU and am therefore not much closer to St3 equivalence despite 6 months of additional experience.
In addition to this I believe extra marks should have been awarded to individuals that have fully completed the primary FRCA (this is what RCP does). Virtually every individual who applied to August 2021 St3 would have had the opportunity to sit both the written and VIVA/Osce once.

I realise that it is unfair to candidates who had disruptions due to the pandemic, but it feels odd to be competing with people who have not passed the primary for a post where it is a requirement. Given how competitive the self assessment scores have been, it definitely feels that my time prepping for the exam could have been better spent in research/publication/presentation/ teaching.

Further to that, there are these and other issues with how the current ST3 recruitment is being done in its watered down state, I'm not convinced you are recruiting the best candidates.

However in the guidance they did give us they did not tell us to include a CV but did tell us to avoid any unnecessary documentation so many people kept additional documents to a minimum as directed.

However I worry that one interview with one panel leads to an increase in the subjectivity and ""luck"" of the process. 

I had an interview for the February 2021 intake, and my panel at the time scored me as being an ""average to poor"" candidate. This came as a horrible shock at the time - I was very well regarded at work by my seniors, peers and colleagues, but I acknowledge my interview technique lead to me not coming across as well as I could have. I recall ""not clicking"" with my interviewers in those first minutes (I had that feeling within a few minutes that my way of answering had irritated one of them). As my awareness of this increased, so I was losing confidence as the interview progressed (and exacerbating the problem). In short, it was a bad interview.

6 months down the line, with practice and training, I was re-interviewed for the August entry, and was marked out as an ""outstanding"" candidate. I clearly benefited from the hard work put into practicing - and am sure that was the key difference. 

I realise that the two interviewers on the panel mark separately, and would like to commend the efforts already made to make the process fair. 

However, this experience has led me to wonder if one interview leaves too much to subjectivity and chance for such a significant appointment. 6 months separated my two interviews, and although I worked hard on improving my technique, I had not fundamentally changed the content of my answers. I wonder whether there should be more than one interview such as in the face-to-face process: eg. one general interview, one clinical interview with two different consultants in each, in order to dilute individual interviewer subjectivity, and insodoing perhaps improve the accuracy with which they might measure a candidate's quality.",603

I now have another 2 years before I can even think of doing this if I want to continue to pursue the career i have heavily invested in so far. This is if I am lucky to get a post in 2023, where the competition for ST4 places will likely be even higher unless there is a significant increase in the number of training posts available to account for the bottleneck.

I informed my educational supervisor and college tutor but they were powerless. I took it upon myself to contact the chair of RAG recruitment, who very kindly informed me that I might still be able to retrieve the points lost by human error by submitting a complaint. 

The ANRO instructions and my correspondence with them did not make it clear that the complaint process was a way of notifying them about appealing for scoring miscalculations due to human error.

We are treated as a number by the NHS and we are not valued as skilled employees. 

The selection process itself is a joke as the portfolio scoring system is just a tick box exercise with no real value. The rigid rules governing selection and even around those who wish to return to training after previously leaving the training programme are completely arbitrary and lack any common sense. The new curriculum changes by the college just add to the uncertainty that we are facing. The fact that we can be treated this way and just have to accept it, combined with the utter lack of planning and common sense shown in the recruitment process, makes me seriously consider whether this is a specialty I want to be a part of and makes me consider leaving medicine altogether.",657

What proportion of those successfully getting st3 numbers this round without the exam are actually on say attempt 5 or 6, and will continue to fail and subsequently relinquish the number? 

In the deanery I applied to, many trainees are on mat leave/OOP/delayed CCT, leaving numbers occupied and without freeing up spaces for new trainees - only 3 numbers available in that region. Is there a way to work around this to allow trainees in?

Entire application process is biased towards trainees with 'tick box' achievements. Does having a PhD (wildly unachievable for most post core trainees) really make you a better anaesthetist? There needs to be more assessment of clinical ability, use of references, letters of recommendation alongside how many publications you've got.

The decision to do so clearly had some rationale, but the fact this was not communicated to anaesthetic trainees whose lives that decision affected is inexplicable.  The person or people who thought this was a good idea should have fronted up and explained to the hundreds of anaesthetic trainees who have passed every assessment asked of them, and gone the extra mile during the pandemic why so few jobs were advertised.  

The selection process into specialty training is, in my view, one of the most critical functions of the RCOA.  The resource allocated to this function should be commensurate with the importance of the decisions being made.  How can it be therefore that just 30 minutes of time is considered adequate to accurately identify the very best candidates?  More time is allocated to every doctors annual ARCP for goodness sake!  I realise there are pressures on everyone's time during the pandemic, but it just seems typical that the compromise should be made on the selection process rather than the enumerate other onerous demands on our time. 

Although I have been offered a job I recognise how flukey this year's selection process was and feel very strongly on behalf of my friends and colleagues that have done everything right and yet have not been given adequate opportunity to demonstrate their skill as anaesthetists.
